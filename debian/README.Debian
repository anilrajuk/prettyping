prettyping for Debian

`prettyping` is a wrapper around the standard `ping` tool with the objective of
making the output prettier, more colorful, more compact, and easier to read.

`prettyping` runs the standard `ping` in the background and parses its output,
showing the ping responses in a *graphical* way at the terminal (by using
colors and Unicode characters).

`prettyping` is written in `bash` and `awk`, and is reported to work on many
different systems (Linux, Mac OS X, BSDâ€¦), as well as running on different
versions of `awk` (`gawk`, `mawk`, `nawk`, `busybox awk`).
